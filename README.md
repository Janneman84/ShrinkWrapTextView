# ShrinkWrapTextView
Fixes oversized text bubbles on Android chat apps!

Have you ever noticed that all chat apps on iOS and Android have one common difference? Once you see it you can't unsee! The difference is sizing of the chat bubbles. On Android chat bubbles that have more than one line of text are always maxed out to their maximum width. This often results in bubbles that are just too big. ShrinkWrapTextView fixes this issue, it's super easy to install so give it a try!

The shrink wrap technology is already being used by Signal messenger.

ShrinkWrapTextView is a subclass of AppCompatTextView.
